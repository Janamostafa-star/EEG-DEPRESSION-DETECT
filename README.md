# 🧠 EEG-Based Depression Detection

> A full-stack mobile health application that detects depression from EEG signals using machine learning — built for accessible, early mental health screening. Achieves **90%+ classification accuracy** on the MODMA dataset.

---

## 📌 Overview

Depression affects over 280 million people globally, yet diagnosis remains largely subjective and inaccessible. This project presents an end-to-end system that analyzes EEG (electroencephalogram) brainwave signals to classify depression, bridging neuroscience and mobile technology into a practical clinical tool.

Built independently as part of the **HSIL Harvard Health Applications Hackathon 2026**, this app demonstrates a complete pipeline from raw EEG signal processing to real-time mobile inference.

## 💡 Software Engineering Highlights

- **Full-stack ownership** — Sole developer across mobile, backend, and ML pipeline
- **RESTful API design** — Clean Flask endpoints decoupling frontend from ML logic
- **Modular architecture** — Signal processing, model inference, and app logic are fully separated concerns
- **Cloud-native** — Firebase handles auth, real-time sync, and storage with no custom infra
- **Cross-platform** — Single Flutter codebase targeting both Android and iOS

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔬 **EEG Signal Processing** — Applies Random Matrix Theory (RMT) denoising to remove noise artifacts from raw EEG recordings
- 🤖 **ML Classification** — Trained classifier on the MODMA dataset achieving **90%+ accuracy** on held-out test data
- 📱 **Cross-platform Mobile App** — Flutter frontend with clean, intuitive UI for patients and clinicians
- ☁️ **Cloud Backend** — Python/Flask REST API hosted with Firebase for real-time data sync and authentication
- 🔐 **Secure Auth** — Firebase Authentication for user management

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the **[MODMA Dataset](http://modma.lzu.edu.cn/data/index/)** — a publicly available, research-grade EEG dataset specifically curated for mental disorder analysis, including depression classification.

- EEG recordings from clinically diagnosed depressed patients and healthy controls
- Preprocessed using RMT-based denoising to isolate genuine neural signal from noise

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK ≥ 3.0
- Python ≥ 3.9
- Firebase project with Firestore & Authentication enabled

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Janamostafa-star/EEG-DEPRESSION-DETECT.git
cd EEG-DEPRESSION-DETECT

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Flask server
python app.py
```

### Flutter Setup

```bash
# Navigate to Flutter app directory
cd flutter_app

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on device/emulator
flutter run
```

> ⚠️ Add your own `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) from your Firebase console. These are excluded from the repo for security.
